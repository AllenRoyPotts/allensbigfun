## Hi, my name is Allen and I **suck** at coding. I'm trying to get better, but

### coding is very tedious and *detail focused*

## What my reading taught me, table of contents

## Class One

### 1. Learning Markdown

### 2. Headings

To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).

### 3. Alternate Syntax

Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.

### 4. Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

### 5. Line Breaks

To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

## Class Two

### 6. Command Line

Opening a terminal is easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.

### 7. Opening Terminal

If you're on a Mac, then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.

### 8. The Shell or Bash

Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.

### 9. Shortcuts

The terminal may seem daunting but don't fret. Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier. You'll be introduced to several of them throughout this tutorial. Take note of them as not only do they make your life easier, they often also save you from making silly mistakes such as typos.

## Basic Navigation

### 10. Current Location

It's one thing to know where we are. Next, we'll want to know what is there. The command for this task is ls. It's short for list. Let's give it a go.

### 11. Paths

n the previous commands we started touching on something called a path. I would like to go into more detail on them now as they are important in being proficient with Linux. Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path. i.e. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

## And Now Some Wise Words

## Bye Bye
